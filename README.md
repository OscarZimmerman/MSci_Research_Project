# MSci_Research_Project
Repository containing the data collected from SWIFT simulations run for investigation into the formation of the Moon. Also contains the python analysis code used to produce the figures in the corresponding report. 

This folder contains the analysis code used in this project. Earlier simulation results, as laid out in the interim report and my lab book to free up storage space, as they were not used in any of the final report results. 

The main areas of focus are the jupyter notebooks data-reader and planetmaker, which contain the python scripts that ran the analysis and produced the figures in the final report, and initialised the initial conditions of the swift simulations respectively. 

Also contained within this folder are the shell scripts, yaml files and python files used in BlueCrystal4 to run the simulations. 

The data is stored within the 'final_results' zip folder attached in submission, further organised by impact parameter and number of collisions. The structure of these results should be taken into account if running any of the python scripts. 

In terms of quantity of data, the simulations that have been fully visualised have all of their data present. However, to save space, for the simulations in which only the final results of the simulation are important to the results (e.g. mass ratios), then only the relevant files have been included. The complete set of data is available upon request.
